In Lesson 3 "watch a front end engineer do this part 2" I see him naming his CSS classes very specific. "title-logo" for instance.  When i did the project prior to watching this video and prior to looking through the CSS Style Guide I had named my classes more generically (so I could use them other places).  I created a class called "margin-20t" and used that instead.  What is the right thing to do here?  Or are both equally okay to do?
