## Project 1
In this project I'll be creating a portfolio page.

### 11/8/2014 - Project Submission
I submitted my project tonight.  I also created a second branch for github pages (gh-pages).  I had to verify my email to make this work. 

### 11/4/2014 - Modal boxes
Need to come back to this.  Moving on to fixing up my project. 


### 11/4/2014 - more stuff to do watching the udacity engineer

I combined these two things into one class he is splitting them out into many classes.
	- DONE - Class for "title-super" -- this creates the big font
	- DONE - Class for "text-thin"  -- this uses the thing font weight
	- DONE - Class for "text-muted" -- this he uses for the "featured work" text
	- DID NOT DO - Class for "title-logo"  -- this he uses to move down the logo 

### 10/30/2014 - Watching engineer do this
Stuff I haven't done and need to think about:
	- DONE - meta tag for IE: http-quiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"
	- DONE - his horizontal rule was put in it's own row in it's own div tag

### 10/20/2014
Overflow: Auto - use this when you want to contain text in a specific element.  Example Udacity course text additions.

display: flex; - Instead of pull left - this forces everything onto a single line in a grid. 
flex-wrap: wrap; - Causes child elements to break and wrap as well.  Can change the order or foce into a single line if need be. 

### 10/13/2014 - Status Update
Going well, need to figure out why my main image isn't center.  Also need to figure out how to have my Udacity Logo take a top margin to push it down to be level with the Joshua Cork text (that gets a buffer aroudn it with the H1 tag).  Also the images goes to center aligned at a certain resolution but not at others.  Need to figure out why.
