## Project 1
In this project I'll be creating a portfolio page.


### 10/13/2014 - Status Update
Going well, need to figure out why my main image isn't center.  Also need to figure out how to have my Udacity Logo take a top margin to push it down to be level with the Joshua Cork text (that gets a buffer aroudn it with the H1 tag).  Also the images goes to center aligned at a certain resolution but not at others.  Need to figure out why.
