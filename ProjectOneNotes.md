## Project 1
In this project I'll be creating a portfolio page.

Overflow: Auto - use this when you want to contain text in a specific element.  Example Udacity course text additions.

display: flex; - Instead of pull left - this forces everything onto a single line in a grid. 
flex-wrap: wrap; - Causes child elements to break and wrap as well.  Can change the order or foce into a single line if need be.

Going well, need to figure out why my main image isn't center.  Also need to figure out how to have my Udacity Logo take a top margin to push it down to be level with the Joshua Cork text (that gets a buffer aroudn it with the H1 tag).  Also the images goes to center aligned at a certain resolution but not at others.  Need to figure out why.
